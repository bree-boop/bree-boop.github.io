<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Once everyone is born no one knows where he or she will do, but we found what we need when the day goes on and how <br>
the environment support us. We might get what we like and makes us happy, also we might get what we don't like but <br>
be happy because we deserve it. Sometimes we love what we don't deserveand make us suffer for long time to be success.</font> </p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="purple">creating your own future:</font></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">
make yourself clear of what you want <br>
see if you can afford it at the life situation you're in<br>
be ready for it no matter what will come to intervene you <br>
know how to get what you deserve and what you like</font> <br></p> 
<p><i><font color="white">MYSELF i just like to get what I like and affordable to my side I ever think of giving up on my future<br>
I learn to be smart and strong, i teach myself to believe on my effort and let my ideas work with it<br> 
I'm not perfect and I can't be perfect but great thing is I can believe on myself and believe on what<br> 
I do,,, every one has to be strong enough to face the challenges and to believe on his or her effort <br> 
Without forgetting prayers.</font></i></p>
